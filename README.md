# Frerers Marius (A Mario Bros. 1983 Game - Level 1-1)

## Introduction
This project contains the source code for a game inspired by the classic Mario Bros. The game is a simple platformer where the player navigates through a level using keyboard controls.

## Getting Started
To launch the game, execute the `Main` class located in the `mechanics` package. This class sets up the main game window and initializes all necessary components for the game to run.

## Controls
The game is controlled using the keyboard with the following keys:
- **Left Arrow**: Move the character to the left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the character to the right.
- **Spacebar**: Make the character jump.

Ensure that your keyboard focus is on the game window to register the key inputs properly.
